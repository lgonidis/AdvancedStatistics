This method estimates model parameters by maximising the likelihood function. In other words, maximising the probability of observing our existing data points given specific parameter values. We will be discussing in details what these parameters are in SEM (e.g., coefficients, latent variable variances, etc.). It should also be noted that MLE is not the only estimation methods, other methods can also be successfully implemented, such as generalised least squares. We decided on the appropriate estimator based on our data characteristics and assumptions."
