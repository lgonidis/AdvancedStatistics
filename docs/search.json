This method estimates model parameters by maximising the likelihood function. In other words, maximising the probability of observing our existing data points given specific parameter values. We will be discussing in details what these parameters are in SEM (e.g., coefficients, latent variable variances, etc.). It should also be noted that MLE is not the only estimation methods, other methods can also be successfully implemented, such as generalised least squares. We decided on the appropriate estimator based on our data characteristics and assumptions."

    "text": "How do we report it?\nNote that the following is just a guideline and was written based on the standardized estimates.\n‘Initial analysis indicated that X significantly predicted M and Y, and M significantly predicted Y. However, when M was incorporated as a mediator in the X and Y relationship a full mediation occurred where the indirect effect was significant (b = 0.23, p &lt; .001, z = 4.57, se = 0.21, ci[0.95] = (0.12 - 0.29), the total effect was also significant (b = 0.17, p &lt; .021, z= 2.32, se = 0.06, ci(0.95) = [0.02 - 0.27]. The direct path of X predicting y was no longer significant (b = 0.06, p = .447, z= -0.76, se = 0.08, ci(0.95) = [-0.21 - 0.09]. Both paths a (X-&gt;M) and b (M-&gt;Y) were significant, (b = 0.51, p &lt; .001, z = 11.68, se = 0.04, ci[0.95] = (0.42 - 0.59) and (b = 0.41, p &lt; .001, z = 5.50, se = 0.07, ci[0.95] = (0.26 - 0.55) respectively. This was in line with our hypothesis that the relationship between X and Y can be entirely explained by changes in M.’"

Feel free to rename the variables in this assignment but do not change the code that generates the data in terms of numbers (You will see that further down in this text).\nFor the purposes of this assignment we will treat the randomly generated data as if they were the real data.

    "text": "Assignment\nWrite the appropriate code that will model the above hypothesis in lavaan and run all required analyses. As we discussed in our workshop there are specific steps that need to be followed before we even run a mediation model. Make sure that you have followed all these steps prior to running a mediation analysis. Following your analysis evaluate whether our hypothesis can be supported, if not suggest and test a more appropriate model. Make sure to offer a justification on the course you chose to follow. This is the point where you can demonstrate a deeper understanding of mediation analysis and critical thinking will allow you to receive higher grades. You should complete your assignment in a quarto file, render it and save as a pdf. You should then upload that pdf file in Canvas. The deadline for this report is Tuesday 13th of February at 4pm."
