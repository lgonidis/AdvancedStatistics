## Challenges by "minions"

1.  Reading all "relevant" studies only to find out that some are horrible in terms of statistical information provided
2.  How far should I take it in terms of removing "influential" cases?
3.  Difficulty in discovering enough studies with "identical" design and statistical figures.
4.  Mainly getting started
5.  How do we go about overcoming difficulties in terms of different measurements or measurements reporting a variety of outcomes

## Challenging Tasks to Complete

1.  You have found a good number of relevant papers, however not all of them use the same design or report the same type of effect size. Find a solution.
2.  Detecting bias. How exactly can we do that?
3.  CHALLENGING: metasem :D
4.  Moderators and sub-group meta analysis
5.  CHALLENGING: Meta-regression. What is it? When and how should we use it?
