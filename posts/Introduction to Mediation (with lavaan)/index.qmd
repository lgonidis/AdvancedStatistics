## Today's Aims

1.  Introduce the concept of Mediation
2.  Discuss a Simple Mediation Model
3.  Use of basic path analysis for Mediation
4.  Use of lavaan for mediation

## Linear models

So far we have discussed linear models where a variable **Y** regresses on **X**

$$
y = b_0 +b_1x_1 + ε
$$

Or, variable **Y** regresses on more than one variables, **X1, X2, ...**

$$
y = b_0 +b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ε_1
$$

## Linear models

These models allowed us to test hypotheses where exogenous observed variables **X1, X2, ...** would have an effect on an endogenous observed variable **Y** However, in this approach we did examine the impact of **X1 on X2, and consequently the impact of X2 on Y.**

## The Simple Mediation Model

Today we will introduce a new concept where two **predicting variables X and M** predict an endogenous observed variable **Y.**

Furthermore, variable **X** also influences variable **M**. We will be referring to variable **M** as our **Mediator.**

It is also worth noting here that different sources and approaches are even stricter on the above by also requesting that these relations are **causal**.

In other words, **X causally influences M and Y, and M causally influences Y.**

1.  **X** should significantly predict **Y** (**path c**, although some authors argue this is not required)

2.  **X** must significantly predict **M (path a)**

3.  **M** must significantly predict **Y (path b)**

## Let us explore an example with data

First we will create some random data. As we mentioned last week, in this module we will be working exclusively with randomly generated data. **Please note that will be required to generate random data for your assignments too.**

```{r}
set.seed(13548) #note that we set the seed to a specific value
X <- rnorm(250) #number of observations
M <- 0.60*X + rnorm(250) # what does the 0.4 and rnorm represent here?
Y <- 0.35*M +  rnorm(250) # what does the 0.6 and rnorm represent here?

df <- data.frame(X=X, Y=Y, M=M)
```

## First we will investigate path c regression

```{r}
model_XY <- lm(Y~X, data = df) # seen above as path c
summary(model_XY)
```

## Path a regression

```{r}
model_XM <- lm(M~X, data = df) # seen above as path a 
summary(model_XM)
```

## Path b regression

```{r}
model_MY <- lm(Y~M, data = df) # seen above as path b  
summary(model_MY)
```

## We will now specify and fit a path analysis model

```{r}
library(lavaan)
library(semPlot)

model_med <- ' # direct effect
             Y ~ c*X
           # mediator
             M ~ a*X
             Y ~ b*M
           # indirect effect (a*b)
             ab := a*b
           # total effect
             total := c + (a*b)
         '
model_med_fit <- sem(model_med, data = df, se = 'bootstrap', bootstrap = 1000, )
```

## Exploring the model

```{r}
summary(model_med_fit, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE, rsquare = TRUE, ci = TRUE)
```

## Parameter Estimates

```{r}
parameterEstimates(model_med_fit, level = .95)
```

## Standardised Parameter Estimates

```{r}
lavaan::standardizedsolution(model_med_fit, level = .95)
```

## Visualising the path analysis mediation model

```{r}
semPaths(model_med_fit,
         whatLabels = "est",
         sizeMan = 10,          
         style = "ram",          
         layout = "tree",
         intercepts = FALSE,
         rotation = 2)
```

## Add significance stars

```{r}
library(semptools)
plot_med <- semPaths(model_med_fit,
         whatLabels = "est",
         sizeMan = 10,          
         style = "ram",          
         layout = "tree",
         intercepts = FALSE,
         rotation = 2, edge.label.cex = 1)
```

## Are you ready for the first headache question?

```{r}
plot_med <- mark_sig(plot_med,model_med_fit)
plot(plot_med)
```

## How can we interpret the above?

We see that the paths **a** and **b** are significant. The same cannot be said for the path **c.** We also have a significant **indirect effect** and a significant **total effect**.

In this case our direct path **c** is no longer significant, hence this is a case of **full mediation**

If **both** the **indirect path ab** and the **direct path c** were significant this would have been a case of partial mediation.

If the **indirect path** was non-significant this would have been a case of **no mediation.**

## How do we report it?

Note that the following is just a guideline and was written based on the standardized estimates.

'Initial analysis indicated that X significantly predicted M and Y, and M significantly predicted Y. However, when M was incorporated as a mediator in the X and Y relationship a full mediation occurred where the indirect effect was significant (b = 0.23, p \< .001, z = 4.57, se = 0.21, ci\[0.95\] = (0.12 - 0.29), the total effect was also significant (b = 0.17, p \< .021, z= 2.32, se = 0.06, ci(0.95) = \[0.02 - 0.27\]. The direct path of X predicting y was no longer significant (b = 0.06, p = .447, z= -0.76, se = 0.08, ci(0.95) = \[-0.21 - 0.09\]. Both paths ***a*** (X-\>M) and ***b*** (M-\>Y) were significant, (b = 0.51, p \< .001, z = 11.68, se = 0.04, ci\[0.95\] = (0.42 - 0.59) and (b = 0.41, p \< .001, z = 5.50, se = 0.07, ci\[0.95\] = (0.26 - 0.55) respectively. This was in line with our hypothesis that the relationship between X and Y can be entirely explained by changes in M.'

## We will now apply what we learnt with a more complex example

Please log on to your Posit account and access the **Week2** project where you can work on an example of serial mediation with 2 mediators.

## Parallel Mediation

## Create the data

```{r}
set.seed(13548) #note that we set the seed to a specific value
X <- rnorm(250) #number of observations
M1 <- 0.60*X + rnorm(250)# what does the 0.4 and rnorm represent here?
M2 <- 0.50*X + rnorm(250)
Y <- 0.35*M +  rnorm(250) # what does the 0.6 and rnorm represent here?

df <- data.frame(X=X, Y=Y, M1=M1, M2=M2)
```

## We will now specify and fit a path analysis model

```{r}
library(lavaan) 
library(semPlot)  
model2_med <- ' 
# alternative syntax of the model            
Y ~ c*X + b1*M1 + b2*M2           
M1 ~ a1*X              
M2 ~ a2*X     

# indirect effects (a*b)              
a1b1 := a1*b1
a2b2 := a2*b2
# total effect              
total := c + (a1*b1) + (a2*b2)          
' 
model2_med_fit <- sem(model2_med, data = df, se = 'bootstrap', bootstrap = 1000)
```

## Exploring the model

```{r}
summary(model2_med_fit, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE, rsquare = TRUE, ci = TRUE)
```

## Parameter Estimates

```{r}
parameterEstimates(model_med_fit, level = .95)
```

## Visualisation of the model

```{r}
plot_med2 <- semPaths(model2_med_fit,
         whatLabels = "est",
         sizeMan = 10,          
         style = "ram",          
         layout = "tree",
         intercepts = FALSE,
         rotation = 2, edge.label.cex = 1)
```

## Add significance stars

```{r}
plot_med2 <- mark_sig(plot_med2,model2_med_fit)
plot(plot_med2)
```

## What would your interpretation be?

## Follow-up topics

This Friday we are having our first Zoom session at 12 noon.

There we will be chatting about questions you might have but I also want you to explore 2 questions.

1.  How can I add a variable in order to investigate for moderation effects between X and M?
2.  How can I control for a specific variable in the simple mediation model? For example how can I control for the impact of age?
